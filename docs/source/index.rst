Multi-dimensional arrays with broadcasting and lazy computing.

Introduction
------------

*xtensor* is a C++ library meant for numerical analysis with multi-dimensional
array expressions.

*xtensor* provides

- an extensible expression system enabling **lazy broadcasting**.
- an API following the idioms of the **C++ standard library**.
- tools to manipulate array expressions and build upon *xtensor*.

Containers of *xtensor* are inspired by `NumPy`_, the Python array programming
library. **Adaptors** for existing data structures to be plugged into the
expression system can easily be written.

In fact, *xtensor* can be used to **process numpy data structures in-place**
using Python's `buffer protocol`_. For more details on the numpy bindings,
check out the xtensor-python_ project. Language bindings for R and Julia are
also available.

*xtensor* requires a modern C++ compiler supporting C++14. The following C++
compilers are supported:

- On Windows platforms, Visual C++ 2015 Update 2, or more recent
- On Unix platforms, gcc 4.9 or a recent version of Clang
