====================

This section provides information about *xtensor*'s internals and its architecture. It is intended for developers
who want to contribute to *xtensor* or simply understand how it works under the hood. *xtensor* makes heavy use
of the CRTP pattern, template meta-programming, universal references and perfect forwarding. One should be familiar
with these notions before going any further.
